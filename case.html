		<h1>Case 1</h1>
		<p>Answer part A. <br>
The Global Green Books Publishing struggled because they recruited only part-
time employees to deal with the latest customer. The problems an employer faces 
because of part-time employees are-
• Lack of sincerity and answerability towards major responsibilities.
• Lack of necessary technological acquaintances. <br>
Answer part B. <br>
Samantha introduced a proper formal project management process. She created a 
project management manual and trained the employees to get the work done. <br>
Answer part C. <br>
• Instead of many part-time employees keep few full –timers. Provide proper 
training to your employees. They should be guided well. <br>
• The Global Green Books lacked a roadmap or project plan and disciplined 
approach to project management. <br>
• No project software’s were available for scheduling. <br>
• They did not have tools or techniques to estimate budget or to communicate 
with stakeholders. <br>
• They had no defined process for risk management and quality management. <br>
Answer part D. <br>
Customer care services business like starting a grocery chain or stepping into the 
fashion industry.
Setting up a mobile industry. We may face the similar situation. <br>
Answer part E.
Samantha has dynamically dealt with the problems faced by Global Green Books. 
She had been successful in eliminating the majority of the issues. She will continue
to work with Global Green for a long time because of her insight and ability to 
handle employees. The technical knowledge can be gained over a period of time.

		<h1>Case 2</h1>
		<p>
		 1) Risks identified for Global Green Books Publishing <br><br>
1. Employ unqualified people (undergraduates who have no
experience and free time) to complete the work.<br>
2. The customer order cannot be delivered on time (the delivery starts
to exceed the date and time requested by the customer).<br>
3. High quality text cannot be provided.<br>
4. As a small business, it chose a big project.<br>
The global green paper publishing industry relies on part-time
employees, which is a high risk. The staff union leads to uncertainty in
working hours, as it delays due to other tasks and delays work.
Inexperienced part-time employees can also lead to a decline in product
quality, and they will have to spend more time and money to fix product
defects. Therefore, these will expose the company to resource risks,
product quality risks and financial risks.<br><br>
2) High risk:<br>
Hiring college students with flexible working hours and no plans, I
think this is one of the high risks. Because the working hours of part-time
college students are uncertain, and the length of working hours is also
uncertain, the result is that the work cannot be completed on time.
Orders that cannot be delivered to customers on time are also a high
risk. Such risks can have a serious impact because failure to provide the
e-books required by the customer on time will delay their arrangements,
causing customers to lose confidence in the company and possibly ending
the contract.<br>
Unable to provide high quality text, the risk level is also high. Product
quality is very important for a business. If the company's printed products
have quality problems, they will have to spend time and money to fix
defects in the product. This will directly lead to delays in delivery and a
financial crisis for the company. At the same time, it also violates the
commitment to customers.<br><br>
Medium risk is a small business that has chosen a big project. If the
global Green Paper publication takes over such a large project and does
not complete well, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, this will have a
serious negative impact on the company and ultimately affect the stability
of the company. <br><br>
3) Not Very likely- Staffing risk- this risk is related to organizational
structure and requires employees to have relevant technology, then
according to the requirements of the order (for example, the employees
we have are not full-time employees, most of them are not adequately
trained), Responsibility can be mitigated through proper training and
hiring full-time employees.<br>
Likely - product quality risk - depending on the situation, the order
has no fixed pattern, all orders come very unevenly, and because the
demand pattern depends on the needs of the teacher and the student, the
work plan is based on the various patterns and needs of the order.
Workflow, with skilled staff to complete the work, thus ensuring the quality
of the product. Otherwise it will affect the company's goodwill and
business.<br>
Very likely to occur – Order delivery time risk - can also be called
project risk. If the demand is not completed on time, the university can
definitely terminate the contract, which will seriously affect the company's
financial structure and the company's reputation.<br><br>
4) This will be the first three risks in the template (employing unqualified
personnel to complete the work, failing to deliver e-books on time and
providing high-quality text), as well as advice on organized project plans
and a standardized approach to solving them. At the same time, internal
and external research is conducted on the complete causes of these
problems.

	<div>
		<h1>Case 3</h1>
		<p>1) Customized ebooks are produced in a completely different way than traditional
books are produced. As this case mentions, each of these eBooks are customized. The
eBooks are customized for courses then for the professor teaching that course even
though the subject/course may be the same. The professors may require content
changes within their respective eBooks too. All the eBooks have the potential for
completely different layouts as well. All of these unique features make each eBook a
different entity which means they cannot be produced like a standard printed textbook.<br>
Since every eBook is a customization by a professor, eBooks are characterized
as unique. If eBooks were the same for every professor, the uniqueness of eBooks
would not exist. Another characteristic of a project for these eBooks is that the content
of the eBook can be changed by the professor. If the content was constant for a
semester or two, then the eBook would need to be created only once. The last
characteristic of an eBook that makes it a project is its limited duration. The eBooks only
last a semester then are recreated so the life cycle is only a semester long. 
<br><br>
2)The stakeholders in the eBook project are the students, professors and any
colleges using these eBooks. Students would be characterized as the primary
stakeholders in the eBooks because they are directly, positively or negatively, impacted
by the project. The direct impact on the students is learning from the eBooks.
Professors and their colleges would be categorized as key stakeholders because they
are indirectly impacted by the eBooks. The professor determines the content while the
college funds the purchase of the books but in the end, neither of the entities are
directly impacted. The indirect impact can be noticed in the student’s grades at the end
of the semester because they used the eBook to help achieve their grades.
<br><br>
3)A defined scope in any project sets the lifespan of the project, giving the project a
definite beginning and ending. A project with a defined scope is more likely to give
desired results than one without a defined project scope.
It is important for there to be an agreement about the scope of the project so that
GGBP can produce the kind of results that the colleges and professors expect. If the
scope is clearly defined in the agreement, the company can better utilize its resources
and prioritize their work. In this case, if the scope of the project is clearly defined by the
professors then GGBP would have to deliver the eBooks on time. Having a fair estimate
about how many eBooks orders there would be would help GGBP create a fair estimate
of how many to produce for each professor. Doing this would have helped allowed
GGBP more time to produce because they would eliminate the rework time on the
eBooks. 
<br><br>
4)The information that the supervisors should have available is the deadlines for
the eBooks. This would enable the supervisors to implement proper time management
to accomplish the task. Since the supervisor is already keeping track of the current
work, if he had the deadlines it would be easier for him to set deadlines. By setting a
deadline, the supervisor would have to utilize time management and potentially save
resources.
<br><br>
5)I think that developing a standard job template would be useful to GGBP. By
creating a standard job template in the form of a list of tasks, employees would have a
more clear way of working. After implementing the list, the tasks would be positioned by
order of importance. Since the workers are flexible and mostly part-time, having a
template to follow would cut down on errors and confusion. The template would also
include any relevant information about resources needed for the task. This way the
workers would be aware of what resources are available and what resources would be
needed down the line. The other thing to include would be a time limit on the tasks. If
there was a set time limit then the workers would be aware of how fast or slow they
would have to work.
<br><br>
6)The first thing that would be important to convey in a kickoff meeting for this type
of project is exactly what the project is, which is creating customized eBooks. From
there, the job template would be the next subject conveyed. By explaining the job
template and how it relates to the project, will help team members understand how to
use it effectively throughout the course of the project. The other subject to convey would
be the deadlines. The managers and team members all need to be aware of the
deadlines so that we could avoid late deliveries of eBooks.
</p>

	<div>
		<h1>Case 4</h1>
		<p>Comment on the following aspects of the case study:
			<br><br>
			A) The direct costs for the project would include labor costs, purchasing the
equipment required for the production of eBooks, along with proper permission to
distribute the eBooks, as well as any facility expenses. The reason why direct
costs are viewed as such is because of the project management skills that are
implemented in the project that would allow for all cost to be traced as well as a
high degree of accuracy which would result in the result of the eBook.
<br><br>
B)The mini case study states that the following types of costs that are identified are
both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are the costs that have been caused
underway of each eBook, as it were, they are the costs that can be followed
straightforwardly up to the last item. The identified costs that ate incorporated are
the expense of utilized images in the distribution of the eBooks and the
substance consent costs.
The other form of cost that has been identified is the indirect cost. Indirect costs
are costs that prohibit the organization from following up with the production of
the eBooks. Other factors that would be included in the production of eBooks
would be the cost of computers as well as sales commissions’ cost that are
brought about during the selling of the eBooks.
<br><br>
C)Mini-Case Study: Cost Estimation at Global Green Books Publishing
A few issues that could emerge that could conceivably have a negative impact of
the financial limit of the project would make suppositions or creative abilities that
are not realistic for the project, failure of appropriate arranging and evaluating the
expense of resources that may be required could prompt conceivable spending
deficiencies, just as having a deficient measure of assets for the execution of the
project and its spending limit
<br><br>
D)Typically, contingency funds are established to cover project risks as well as any
additional costs both recognized and obscure. Global Greens would set aside
contingencies to get ready for any unanticipated occasion or situation that
happens and accompanies a related expense. In the event of quality reviews,
and the demand exceeds the budget, the company will be forced to carry out
adjustments in the components of the budget, to accommodate adequately any
costs. Whenever, where, and the amount of possibility reserve will be spent isn't
known until a hazard occasion happens. For example, if necessary, revise is
gotten in the quality audits, the possibility reserve will cover this coincidental cost.
The possibility reserve is along these lines how coincidental costs like improve
got in the quality surveys can be represented in project budgets.
<br><br>
E)Direct Material: Permits all expenses for substance and images utilized in the
eBook.<br>
Direct Labor: Labor costs for people inside the association taking a shot at the
task.<br>
Subcontract Labor: Expenses of work done outside of the association.
Equipment and Facility Costs: Cost of all equipment and facilities utlizies to
facilitate the project<br>
This project have a few cost drivers, for instance, the quantity of direct hours
worked, the consent required in production of each eBook, the number of
mechanical hours as well as the procurement of the machines.
<br><br>
F)I would have liked to see some information concerning the measure of consents
and time it will take to acquire those permissions as well as the intangible cost.
Intangible costs represent a variety of expenses such as losses in productivity,
customer goodwill, drops in employee morale, loss of brand value, or damage to
corporate reputation. Considering the fact that the customer expected these
books to be delivered at a low cost, and the company has not always been doing
that, I think there should be some immaterial expense related to every project
<br><br>
Create a budget for the European History eBook project.
<br>
A) The three major phrases are as follows:
<br>1. Received Order Phase
<br>2. Plan Order Phase
<br>3. Production Phase
<br><br>
B) The total cost for the direct labour is $664.00
<br><br>
C) The total estimate cost of the ebook costs 23,689.80.

		<h1>Case 5</h1>
		<p>
		A) <br>The project stakeholders in this study are the shareholders –
Green Books Publishing and the senior professor, the supervisor,
suppliers, creditors, Customer Service Representative, the Publishers
Liaison, the local college, the employees, and the students. <br><br>
The key stakeholders would be the shareholders - Green Books
Publishing and the senior professor, the supervisor, suppliers, and the
employees.
<br><br>
B) The requested changes in this case study could have serious
implications on the budget.
<br> 1. Budget alleviation
<br> 2. Clear difference in BAC and EAC
<br> 3. Cost over run
<br> 4. Utilization of Management Reserves
<br> 5. Increase in Administrative and Resource cost
<br><br>
C) Yes, the requested changes in this case study also impact the
schedule. <br>
Impact<br>
1. Schedule Alleviation
<br> 2. Increase in Human Resource Work hours
<br> 3. Delay in delivery of final version of eBook
<br><br>
D) The process dealing with changes from their customers are:<br>
1. Issue Communication within organization
<br> 2. Estimation of CR impact on cost <br>
In our opinion, there are some issues with Global Green Books
Publishing process for dealing with change request which include：
<br> 1. Lack of communication with customer
<br> 2. Inadequate stakeholder management
<br> 3. Lack of coordination in teams
<br> 4. Unassertive dealing with customer
<br> 5. Lack of professionalism
<br> 6. Lack of documentation 
<br><br>
E) Strong communication with customer regarding issues and
challenges
<br> Coordination meetings with customer (sharing of performance and
challenges faced by project team)<br>
Global Green Books need to take after clear especially described
stretch out organization practices to perceive the unmistakable stage in
the wander, clear area and leave criteria of each stage, detail cost
estimation and time estimation are required.<br>
Global Green Books need to fill the role of wander organization and
unmistakably, describe the terms and conditions for satisfying the
movements.
<br><br>
F) Global Green Books need to take after particularly portrayed expand
organization technique and use standard formats to grasp standard
practices in appropriating with the objective that deviations can be
constrained. In any case, including the entire accomplice on the wander is
key and confers clear goals of the wander, for instance, cost and course of
occasions, timetable and no. of changes to each one of the accomplices,
as a matter of first importance, is astoundingly fundamental.
<br> 1. Call stakeholder coordination meeting especially with Professor and
Bookstore Manager
<br> 2. Clear discussion on the challenges faced by the Global Green Book
Publishing
<br> 3. Agree on some compliant solutions for the conflicts
<br> 4. Record meeting minutes and share with stakeholders

<h1>Case 6</h1>
<p>Introduction<br>
	Being a supervisor may give off an impression of being a simple occupation that basically requires advising workers what to do, yet this isn't the situation. A manager confronts challenges in running a reasonable and successful work environment. The greatest test of being a boss may vary, contingent on individual qualities and shortcomings, yet some regular obligations and objectives challenge numerous directors.<br>
Challenges facing supervisors
	Some of the challenges supervisors face include increased demands for them to do more complicated tasks. These supervisors only started out as print technicians, now they have to interact with customers, internal account managers and customer representatives. some of the challenges they face include knowing the status of the work, some have to deal with conflicts in the teams.<br>
Skills supervisors need to be effective project managers
	They must be both leaders and managers . They truly need to merge together their staff to make profoundly able, beneficial venture groups for these quick paced eBook ventures. The staff needs to believe each other and their administration to be reasonable and to adjust work needs with the times that they are accessible. Bosses need to give authority, to give motivation to their group, and to be great sparks of their colleagues, and also be a decent chief, agonizing over the everyday and moment by-moment achievement of the venture's objectives. Being a decent spark additionally implies that the chiefs must be great audience members to comprehend what issues are standing up to their colleagues and the requirements of their colleagues.<br>
Skills that team members need to be effective team members in a project
	The supervisors were understanding that as a team they required two things. One was a more prominent handle of relationship building abilities, or alleged "delicate" aptitudes, to make them more successful. The other was more backing in venture administration as they expected to better track the points of interest of the work, and the errand level booking and rescheduling that was going on as colleagues go back and forth for their work shifts and as authorizations once in a while take more time to acquire than arranged.<br>
Most Significant characteristic of an effective project manager
	For me a project manager ought to be a motivating individual. They have to give authority, to give motivation to their group, and to be great inspirations of their colleagues, and also be a decent chief. This has a method for creating the best out of the group.<br>
 Steps project managers take to help make their teams more effective
	Maybe some leadership improvement training  for supervisors could be masterminded. Additionally setting up a Project  management  office (PMO) to have venture administration staff accessible to help the What guidance would you surrender Samantha about setting an undertaking administration office? What parts could these staff perform, and how would they be able to interface with the current ventures? bosses with some of their work following and planning challenges.<br>
Advice I would  give Samantha about setting up a project management office
	The calendar administration capacity of a PMO helps the system by recognizing venture level turning points and incorporating them into a general project level arrangement. The system level arrangement is a compressed perspective of basic project turning points. the execution administration capacity incorporates venture level status reporting and produces the project level status for official surveys. The PMO examines particular execution issues and imparts early cautioning indications of vexed ventures. The PMO likewise authorizes predictable execution reporting rules so every undertaking reports venture execution reliably.<br>
Other ways that this PMO function could be organized
She can consider to organize her PMO in such a way that it's a supportive PMO. The Supportive PMO by and large gives support as on-interest skill, layouts, best practices, access to data and aptitude on different ventures, and so forth. This can work in an association where undertakings are done effectively in an approximately controlled way and where extra control is esteemed superfluous. Additionally, if the goal is to have a kind of "clearing-house" of venture administration data over the endeavor to be utilized unreservedly by task chiefs, then the Supportive PMO is the right sort.<br>
Conclusion
	Right training is a test that bosses need to meet. This can be intense at times, especially when the organization spending plan doesn't consider a lot of time or assets for preparing. Working with a negligibly prepared staff requires a chief to invest more energy checking representatives since the absence of preparing just about certifications laborers will have issues performing their employments.

		<h1>Case 7</h1>
		<p>
			A) What are some of the reasons why it is important to close out a project? What can project managers accomplish in closing out a project?  The PMO team was discussing making changes to the PM manual and holding a short training for supervisors to implement some improvements to their project completion processes. They wanted to change their standard job template to incorporate these additions:<br>
• a planned task for supervisors to close out the project,<br>
• a task to create a lesson learned report, and<br>
• an optional task for a closing celebration for the team to mark the end of the project,<br>
Supervisors liked the ideas, especially because the close-out meeting or team celebration would give them a chance to recognize and reward team members and would serve to motivate the teams for future projects.<br>
B) Why should projects capture lessons learned? What are some ways that the project team members, project managers and the organization can use lessons learned?  These could be collated by the supervisors at the end of the project, or they could encourage supervisors to plan, schedule and hold a project closing meeting with their team members to thank the team members and to collect lessons learned from all of the team. Delays in obtaining necessary reprint permissions from certain publishers were the largest cause of problems, accounting for 34% of the problems encountered by eBook projects. Production staff calling in sick was the next most frequent problem, accounting for 28% of the problems. Customer changes, which often caused rework and delays, were the root cause of another 20% of the problems.<br>
C) What benefits come from celebrating project accomplishments? Do you believe that rewards and recognition can serve as motivators for staff?  The PMO received management approval for these changes, updated the PM manual, and held a brief training for supervisors. Supervisors liked the ideas, especially because the close-out meeting or team celebration would give them a chance to recognize and reward team members and would serve to motivate the teams for future projects. As time went on, the PMO started collecting these lessons learned from many projects.<br>
D) Explain what a Pareto chart is. Why would you use this technique to identify and prioritize problem areas? Are there some limitations on interpreting the results of a Pareto analysis?  A Pareto chart is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. The idea behind a Pareto Chart is that the few most significant defects make up most of the overall problem. We have already covered two ways the Pareto Charts help find the defects that have the most cumulative effect. First, the first bars are always the tallest, indicating the most common sources of defects. Second, the cumulative percentage line indicates which defects to prioritize to get the most overall improvement.<br>
E) If you were the PMO looking at this Pareto analysis, what recommendations might you make to address the three key problem areas in eBook projects that this analysis identified?  In Pareto analysis, I identified three key problems, which they highlighted in red. Delays in obtaining necessary reprint permissions from certain publishers were the largest cause of problems, accounting for 34% of the problems encountered by eBook projects.

	<div>
		<h1>Case 8</h1>
		<p>
			A) What are some of the challenges facing project teams? Have you encountered any of these problems in teams that you have been part of? What other team problems have you experienced?  Some deal managing conflicts as they arise – both technical issues as permissions are delayed and content cannot yet be incorporated, leading to scheduling changes, and inter-personal issues among staff. Some of these conflicts occur between a mostly young, part-time contingent of student workers and the full-time employees. In teamwork, we often encountered deadline problems. some students did not throw off work on time. this led to even more problems. <br>
			B) Are there skills that team members need to be effective team members in a project? If so, what are these skills?  Key skills<br>
• Teamwork skills<br>
• Problem-solving skills<br>
• Programming languages (different types of developer role require different languages)<br>
• Excellent organisational and time management skills<br>
C) Why is it important that team members understand the goals and scope of the project?  Supervisors are finding it is very important to make sure every team member understands the goals of the project, the roles of each team member and how they inter-relate, and the sense of urgency about completing the project. This urgency comes from understanding the intense schedules for completing eBooks and from understanding why it is important that all of the work come together to create a finished eBook – any part not completed keeps the final eBook from going into quality check and release.<br>
D) Think about creating a team charter. What categories of guidelines would you you’re your team to agree on before beginning work? Why would you include these categories?  1. Start with the context. Who is the team leader? What should key stakeholders expect from this team? What does each contributor bring to the team? What are their individual expectations? Have everyone on the team write out their answers to these questions.<br>
2. Define your vision and objectives. What does success look like for your team? In an ideal world, what would you accomplish? How are you working to support the rest of the org? Create a succinct mission statement that outlines what you hope to achieve.<br>
3. Create deadlines, goals, and milestones that map back to the mission statement. Define roles and responsibilities. Who is doing what? For whom? What does each team member need to achieve their goal?<br>
4. Lay out your checks and balances. To create an effective team charter, you have to balance the aspirational with the tangible. The aspirational part of the charter is the mission statement and the vision. But it’s just as crucial to measure your progress toward your goals. Your charter should lay out the internal checks and balances that will ensure you’re reviewing everyone’s progress. How will you check in? When or how often? How will you measure success?<br>
5. Have everyone on the team sign off on the charter. Many teams like to print it out and ask teammates to physically sign the paper, to symbolize their commitment.<br>
E) Brainstorm and identify some guidelines that you would suggest teams follow for each of these categories?<br>
- Team member participation in the project<br>
- Team member conduct (or behavior)<br>
- Communicating among project members (including communicating status and problems)<br>
- Holding meetings  In my opinion all of these are very important, while you work in team. Teamwork is efficient where every member work in web and help each other.<br>
F) What are the advantages of a kick-off meeting? What are the advantages of developing a team charter?  We are working with some the supervisors to hold a project kick-off meeting where the team reviews the goals and plan for the project and develops and agrees to a project team charter. Letting the team develop their charter gives the supervisor an opportunity to observe how the team works together and gives the team the ability to set ground rules for how they will work together. The team charter starts with the project goals. The team may set their goals to accomplish these project goals. The benefits of a team charter are numerous including Ensuring buy-in from all team members. Holding all team members accountable. Clarifying roles and responsibilities within the team. Demonstrating the team's purpose to the rest of the organization.

		<h1>Case 9</h1>
		<p>
			A) Consider the problems that Samantha and the group identified. What do you think are the causes of these problems?  One of the key causes of this problem is a lack of quality management competence among Global Green Book personnel. A lack of coordination and information sharing across several teams could also be a contributing factor. There are no quality checks in the middle of creating an eBook. There is a lack of focus among team members on quality parameters.
<br>B) What would you suggest they do differently to eliminate these problems?  Conducting quality-control workshops with team members in order to meet client expectations. Carry out quality inspections at each stage of the manufacturing process. Conducting training seminars for GGBN workers on their job responsibilities and steps to take.
<br>C) Who should be responsible for quality? What would you recommend be the specific responsibilities of each identified role?  Samantha should check the quality of the output produced at each level of the production phase as a key manager. She should make sure that every team member is aware of the quality standards that are necessary for specific clients. Consumer support professionals on the client side must assume responsibility in the event that a danger is discovered after the product has been delivered to the customer. They must do so by inspecting the quality at each stage of the manufacturing process. Project managers must understand how a product's quality should be measured and implemented in order to meet higher quality standards.
<br>D) What prevention activities would you suggest to prevent poor quality in the eBook products? Examples could be planning for quality activities or team building activities focused on improving quality  Create and assign tasks to members to execute quality checks at every phase in a project. Create a systematic quality procedure to solve the challenges with the current procedure. Identify the primary quality concerns at planned test scenarios before the product is given to the client.
<br>E) What appraisal activities would you suggest to evaluate the eBook product to ensure that it meets quality standards and customer requirements? Should they add in-process checks of eBook components in addition to their current final inspection/tests? If so, who should do these?  Samantha should make a plan to go through her normal work and assess the quality of each review phase. Managers should be ready to conduct the evaluation and, if necessary, take action to demonstrate the change. Document the most important concerns in a systematic manner, discuss them with coworkers, and bring them up in frequent meetings. To generate higher-quality products, identify appropriate suggestions and apply them into future life cycles.
<br>F) What would you suggest they do to involve team members more in pursuit of high quality eBooks for their customers?  Team members can set daily goals and discuss them with supervisors to have a better notion of how to put them into action. Managers should establish a variety of ways to communicate with team members and discuss the project's quality requirements. Recognize team members and assist them in improving in their weak areas. Managers should solicit input from team members on quality parameters and attempt to review them collectively.
